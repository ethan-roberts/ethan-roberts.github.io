In class, we were introduced to Prezi. Prezi is a website where you can create presentations zooming in and out etc. We then continued to make our accounts which we used to get used to what Prezi is like. We took them off of a template list. We then learnt how to input images and arrows on our presentation to make it look nice and choose the path. We also learnt how to zoom into the presentations to make it look not that boring. We were then set on homework to create our own presentations on "The History Of Computers. This helped us on starting to learn what it is like to make a presentation and the rules what to do when delivering a presentation.
