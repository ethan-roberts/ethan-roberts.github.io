In Year 7 I have learnt from I.T in many different ways and learnt new things from the topics. I now can recognise things in the media and what the message portrays etc. I think my strengths in year 7 have been focusing in the tasks we were told to do and following the instructions to every to detail for things like the microbit. I think my weaknesses are taking what is said into thought and using that to adapt my work which I cannot do very well. The target I would set for myself in year 8 is to pay attention to detail in the discussions and use that to expand my working capability by memorising it or taking notes to help me at home or in the nearer future.
