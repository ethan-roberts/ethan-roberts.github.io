Title: Editing our Github                  Date: 29/9/16

Starting point: My github blog being boring.

Target for the lesson: To make my blog to look cooler than before.

Did I reach my target? Yes.

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

I learnt by understanding what the task was and completing it step by step. We were shown how to make our blogs have new things by simply just looking it up and not just ask the teacher how to do it. Taking this all into account and just persevering really helped.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

I understood what Mr Keen was talking about and how we should do it on our own but I wasn't really managed for time. I still finished what I was hoping to do in the first place but I could have achieved a lot more than just rushing to do one thing.

What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?

I will complete the task set in the right amount of time and try to not rush. I will improve my learning by thinking of new ideas to add to my style.css on my blog.
