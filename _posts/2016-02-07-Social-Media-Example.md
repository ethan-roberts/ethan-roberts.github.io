We described how we felt connected with someone with social media using a shared google doc.

Later we watched some videos, the first one was about a girl and everywhere she went people were on social media stuck to their phones. Things like a man taking a photo while kissing after he proposed to his lover to share on social media.

We watched a music video about twitter. Everyone is happy talking about twitter and there is a girl at the start thinks its annoying because they are on it everywhere they go. However at the end she gets influenced that twitter is the best and joins in singing about it.
