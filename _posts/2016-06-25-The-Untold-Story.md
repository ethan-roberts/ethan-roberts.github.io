We talked about types of media such as commercials, radio, magazines and newspapers. We watched an advertisment in the lesson about hamsters that were exercising and going to an event in the latest kia. We picked out the text (what you can see) and then the subtext which is the hidden message. We learnt how to do this and discussed the untold story in the advert. We came to a conclusion that the hidden message that if you are slim, you will become famous and be driving a kia. We thought about the target-market for the people buying the kia to be middle aged men and women. This lesson helped us to pick out subtext in adverts.
