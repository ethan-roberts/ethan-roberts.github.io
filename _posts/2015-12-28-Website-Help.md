**What we did in class**

In class, we were designing how we were going to customise our website. First of all we went into the "_config.yml" file to change the name of the website and the description underneath. Later on we went into the “style.scss” file and changed the colour of the background, text etc by using a HTML code generator for colours we wanted ([http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp)). After we changed the fonts by using the same way we changed the colour by a font code generator ([http://www.cssfontstack.com/](http://www.cssfontstack.com/)). 

**How to fix your errors in GitHub**

If you have an error with your code you can find it by Repository > Settings > GitHub Pages. Under the heading github pages you should see if your website is published or if there is an error. 

Here it tells you where your error is and what line it is on in the code. It could be anything wrong such as a missing space or a semi-colon needed. If you don't know how to fix it then see the website it reccomends.

In this simple error I have missed a space between the title which is easy to fix. Other errors may be not this simple. Once you have fixed the errors go back to settings in the repository and see if it has made the website work.

You should see Your site is ready to be published at (name of your website) which will proceed to become  Your site is published at (name of your website).
