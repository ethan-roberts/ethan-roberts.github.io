    <td>I learned by exploring what I could do through the simple basic codes we were instructed to do. We were taught and had to listen carefully and remember the code and commands used. This was later finished for homework so I wrote notes in my planner reminding me how to do the vlookup command.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning again as I was focusing more on the task. In the end I got to the end result I was looking for working on vlookup. Sometimes I struggled on some aspects of the learning process so I resulted to the internet which was very useful looking at tutorials how to successfully use the vlookup command.
