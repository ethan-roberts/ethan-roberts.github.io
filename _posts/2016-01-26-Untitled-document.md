In class we discussed about different media examples which have fantasy aspects in them. We watched a pepsi advertisement where the taxis driver is a chimpanzee, which is clearly fantasy as chimpanzees don't drive taxis. We also looked at Mcdonaldâ€™s burgers in real life compared to the advertisements you see in your everyday lives. They use the exact same recipe that they use in the restaurants and take hours to make it look like it's perfection. They did things like cook the edge of the meat to make it wider and nicer looking, they also used a syringe on the burger with things like ketchup and mustard. Their "food artist" also blowtorched the cheese to make it look good. Now after this lessons we can easily spot what is fantasy and what is not.
