    <td>A blog with no table or borders around the text.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a neatly organised blog within tables that I have designed and customised.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I took good notes that I feel I used effectively. Also, I used the website "W3schools" allot to help with the processes and details I couldn't remember and didn't take down in my notes. This helped as it had all the information I needed and I feel I used this website to the best of its use. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>in this lesson I feel I didn't use my common sense as much as I could. This is because when I started the lesson I took about 5 minutes to try and find the piece of code within the css script that I needed to edit my table, but then realised that I needed to add it in myself. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>For next time, I need to instead of when I reach a hurdle trying to look through my notes and go in other websites but ultimately getting stuck, I should first use common sense and think about the task before I go straight ahead for it.</td>
