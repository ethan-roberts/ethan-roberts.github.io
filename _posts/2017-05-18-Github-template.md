    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I read the instructions in detail and learnt from the things we did. Each time I came across a challenge I used my new skills I had learnt from the previous task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was trying to do random things without reading the instruction box and when it tells you the error and how to fix it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is not rushing to the task but to take it slow and use my skills that I have learnt and hopefully improve my python skills.</td>
