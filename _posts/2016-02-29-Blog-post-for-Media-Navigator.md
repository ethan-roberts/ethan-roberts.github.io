In our lesson, we shared our identity maps with each other and commented on it to simulate social media. Making my identity map I had tried to make it artistic in a way. I had a feeling everyone would talk about me including words. I had tried to judge them in a strict way on my comments as it is what people would do on social media. It was an interesting system to follow as you don't know who the unknown commenters are. At the end of the lesson we looked at our comments. I got a lot of comments saying "Too much pictures", “write something”, “you need to include words” and “write something bro” and I agreed with it although everyone had pretty much wrote the same comments. This process is different from online commenting because we know it’s our class writing them, if it was online, it could be anybody.

 After our lessons of social media, my opinion was changed. I would have thought it was a nice place where only your friends can see what you do, after all what we have learnt now i know to be safer on social media in the future
