    <td>I learnt how to use slices in code which is helpful making things easier when coding by acting as a shortcut method and help to list things. I learnt this mainly by reading the instructions and learning from the examples.</td>

    <td>Sometimes the instructions were not as clear and I had to adapt to it and eventually understand what it was telling us and alter the code.</td>
