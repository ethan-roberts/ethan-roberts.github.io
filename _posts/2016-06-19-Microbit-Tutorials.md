In lesson we carried on with Microbit tutorials from our homework. We started to work on other ones as well. We used the Microbit Cookbook as the tutorials we used kept on glitching by asking to do the same thing. Some of the end microbit codes were very long and I couldn't complete by the lesson time. We wanted to do 2 per lesson but it was quite hard because they were long. These tutorials will help us create our games we have planned as this teaches us basics and ways to create and do certain things.
