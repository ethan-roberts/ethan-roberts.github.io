End of year 8

The thing I have enjoyed the most in IT year 8 has probably been controlling the robot arms. It was really interesting as we controlled it to do simple things such as picking up pencils and handing it to you. I think overall IT was enjoyable with everything we have done because it is a fun way of learning things. Codecademy took lots of time and was much harder than the fuze boxes which we just followed the manual. In codecademy, even though it was more time consuming, it payed off and made us learn more than we learnt from the fuze boxes and robot arms.
