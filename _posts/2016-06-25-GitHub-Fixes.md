In our lesson we fixed our GitHub blogs by deleting the repository and creating it again from Barry Clark's jekyll-now. By doing this, it prevented our GitHubâ€™s from breaking again. This taught us how to fix it if it ever broke again. I made a mistake in the lesson by copying my old repository and pasting it into my new one. I learnt not to do that again as it breaks it even more. We chose our colour schemes in the style.scss file and customised our avatar icons again.
