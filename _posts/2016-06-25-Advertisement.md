We learnt about fantasy and non-fantasy and how they are used in advertisements. For example we looked at the making of Mcdonald's burgers that you see in pictures. They use the same ingredients but spend hours making it perfect. They make it so that the ingredients are seen in the photo and the meat done to the best they can do. They syringe tomato ketchup and melt the cheese so it's just right. This is all done by the mcdonald's food artist.
