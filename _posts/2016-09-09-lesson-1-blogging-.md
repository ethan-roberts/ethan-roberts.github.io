    <td>For me, I took quite a lot of notes and included all the information I needed in those notes to be able to complete the tasks I was set. This meant that I didn't have to ask for help and I didn’t get held back by questioning what to do. I also feel I worked fairly effectively and didn’t get distracted by anyone.

  <tr>
    <td>At some points I did stop to check with other people whether my work was correct and that did slow me down. Also, once I authorised my account with Gabriel I didn’t understand what to do where I could have simply reloaded Gabriel.    </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I did this because I didn’t trust my notes fully and in future I should do what I think is correct and is in my notes not what others are doing
