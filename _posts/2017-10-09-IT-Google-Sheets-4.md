    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by exploring what I could do through the simple basic codes we were instructed to do. We were told to do simple commands which allowed our virtual shops to be able to have discounts and different fees for different aspects of the shop.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning again as I was focusing more on the task. In the end I got to the end result I was looking for working on vlookup. Sometimes I struggled on some aspects of the learning process so I had asked my partner to give me a rough idea of how the discount process worked without him telling me the full answer.
