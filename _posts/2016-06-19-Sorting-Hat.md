In class we were introduced to microbit. Microbit is a website like scratch but more advanced, it is used to teach people basic coding. We were shown how to follow tutorials on the website. The task for the lesson was to replicate the way the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter works. This was basically a random generator. We followed the tutorials and did all the houses in Harry Potter such as Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. We then added more code but did it with the Dr Challoners houses which there were 6 of rather than 4. As an extension we added the names of people in our class to the generator so it picked out the name of someone in our class. If I was doing it again, I would be playing around with new things to try and improve it a bit more.
