In class we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of social media. In the lesson we alternated writing on the whiteboard good and bad things about social media. We put ideas for advantages like:

-You can keep in touch with your friends and family

-Be up to date in the latest news

For disadvantages ideas like:

-People can cyber bully you by saying nasty things

-You can get hacked (unlikely)

-People can put stuff up of you without your consent

-People can stalk you and find where you live 

There are more disadvantages than advantages in social media. We had learnt to be careful online and understand the bad things of social media.
