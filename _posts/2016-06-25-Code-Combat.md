In lesson we went on a website called codecombat to learn basic coding. In this coding game, we had to guide our characters what to do and where to go. We upgraded our characters through more and more levels. We used code to make our characters move up and down, left and right and attack other entities to finish the levels. The levels got harder and harder so as you got through them, the coding became more advanced
