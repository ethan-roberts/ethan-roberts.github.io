Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

We learnt by mainly just reading to understand what we were meant to do. Last week we did not actually read and we were stuck on a page. So from now on I will read all the details to understand for example this week we made pictures with our code. Each number represented a coordinate type of thing on where to draw it and how thick it is etc.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

In the lesson it was harder because the code we had to type was longer. As we went on we had more of a challenge to tackle. This helped us in a way as it got bigger and bigger for practice for the really challenging things in the end. We need to work on actually interpreting what the string of code we input actually means, in some ways we used the power of reading to help us.

What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?

Next time we should be careful in the code we write to save time so we do not have to go back and try and find the error. To improve my learning I will gradually learn what each piece of code means so it is easier to make.
